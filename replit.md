## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using a modern React-based stack with TypeScript:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

The UI follows a component-based architecture with reusable shadcn/ui components, maintaining consistency across the application with a custom design system featuring brand colors and proper responsive design.

### Backend Architecture
The backend uses a Node.js/Express setup with modern ES modules:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **File Processing**: Multer for file uploads with support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, and MD files
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API for content generation

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following key design decisions:
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM chosen for type safety and performance
- **Schema**: Comprehensive schema supporting users, documents, courses, modules, lessons, quizzes, enrollments, and progress tracking
- **Migrations**: Database migrations managed through Drizzle Kit
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL for scalability and ease of deployment

## Key Components

### AI Processing Pipeline
The core feature is a 5-phase AI document processing system:
1. **Document Analysis**: Extract and analyze document content
2. **Content Analysis**: Identify learning objectives and structure
3. **Content Generation**: Create modules, lessons, and educational content
4. **Validation**: Ensure content quality and coherence
5. **Finalization**: Complete course structure and metadata

### User Management System
- **Production-Ready Authentication System**
  - Secure user registration with email and password
  - Password hashing using bcryptjs with salt rounds
  - JWT token-based authentication stored in httpOnly cookies
  - Session management with automatic token refresh
  - Protected API routes with authentication middleware
  - Logout functionality with cookie clearing
- Support for two user types: creators and learners
- User profiles with role-based access control
- Email verification support (field ready for implementation)

### Course Management
- Complete course creation workflow from document upload to published courses
- Module and lesson organization with hierarchical structure
- Quiz generation with multiple question types
- Progress tracking and enrollment management

### File Processing
- Multi-format document support (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- File validation and size limits (50MB)
- Secure file storage and content extraction

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload documents through the file upload interface
2. **AI Processing**: Documents are processed through the 5-phase AI pipeline
3. **Course Generation**: AI generates structured courses with modules and lessons
4. **Content Review**: Creators can edit and refine generated content
5. **Publishing**: Courses are made available to learners
6. **Learning Experience**: Learners enroll, progress through content, and take quizzes
7. **Progress Tracking**: System tracks completion and performance metrics

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Google Gemini AI**: Primary AI service for content generation and analysis
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components for accessibility and consistency
- **React Hook Form**: Form management with validation
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management and caching

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: JavaScript bundling for production

### File Processing
- **Multer**: File upload middleware
- **Various file parsers**: For extracting content from different document formats

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
- **Frontend**: Vite builds the React application to static assets
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles the Node.js server with external dependencies
- **Output**: Separate builds for frontend (static) and backend (Node.js)

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Gemini AI integration via `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Development vs production configuration handling

### Production Readiness
- Static asset serving in production
- Proper error handling and logging
- Session management with connect-pg-simple
- File upload limits and validation
- CORS and security considerations

The architecture is designed for scalability with serverless database hosting, efficient AI processing pipelines, and modern frontend deployment patterns. The system can handle the complete lifecycle from document upload to course consumption while maintaining performance and user experience quality.
