# CHAPTER 4: Data Preparation, Cleaning, and Descriptive Analytics

## 4.1. HR Scenario: Consolidating Employee Data for Strategic Analysis

As the newly appointed Head of People Analytics at Global Innovations Inc., Maya faces her first significant challenge. The CEO has requested a comprehensive analysis of employee demographics, performance, and retention patterns to inform the company's five-year strategic plan. This seems straightforward until Maya discovers the reality of the company's HR data landscape.

The employee information Maya needs is scattered across multiple systems and files:
- Basic demographic data lives in the HRIS (Workday)
- Performance ratings and reviews are in a separate performance management system
- Compensation data is stored in Excel spreadsheets maintained by the Compensation team
- Training records exist in the Learning Management System
- Employee engagement survey results are in exported CSV files from the survey vendor
- Recruitment data is in the Applicant Tracking System
- Historical data from acquired companies exists in various formats and structures

Each of these systems uses different employee identifiers, date formats, job codes, and department naming conventions. Some files have missing data, others contain duplicate records with conflicting information, and many include text fields with inconsistent formatting. The data spans five years, but system changes and acquisitions have created inconsistencies in how information has been recorded over time.

Maya realizes that before she can deliver any meaningful analysis to the CEO, she must undertake a significant data preparation and cleaning effort. She needs to:

1. Consolidate data from multiple sources into a unified employee dataset
2. Resolve inconsistencies in identifiers, codes, and naming conventions
3. Clean and standardize data formats
4. Handle missing values and duplicate records
5. Create a reliable master dataset that can be used for ongoing analytics

This scenario highlights the fundamental challenge facing HR analytics professionals: before any sophisticated analysis can take place, data from various sources must be properly prepared and cleaned. Without this critical foundation, any subsequent analysis would be built on shaky ground, potentially leading to misleading insights and flawed strategic decisions.

## 4.2. Data Quality Fundamentals

### Common HR Data Quality Issues

HR data is particularly susceptible to quality issues due to the various ways it is collected, stored, and managed across organizational systems. Understanding these common challenges is the first step toward addressing them:

**Inconsistent Identifiers**: Employees may be identified differently across systems—by employee ID in the HRIS, by email address in the LMS, by name in manual spreadsheets, or by a combination of identifiers in legacy systems from acquisitions.

**Duplicate Records**: The same employee may appear multiple times in datasets due to system transfers, role changes, or manual data entry errors. These duplicates often contain conflicting information about the same person.

**Missing Values**: Critical fields may be empty due to optional form fields, system migrations, or process gaps. Common examples include missing hire dates, incomplete job histories, or blank demographic information.

**Inconsistent Naming Conventions**: Department names, job titles, and location descriptions often lack standardization across systems and over time (e.g., "IT," "Information Technology," "Tech" all referring to the same department).

**Format Inconsistencies**: Date formats may vary (MM/DD/YYYY vs. DD/MM/YYYY), text case may differ (uppercase, lowercase, proper case), and numbers may be formatted differently (percentages vs. decimals).

**Coding Differences**: Job codes, salary grades, and performance ratings scales may change over time or differ between business units, making longitudinal or cross-organizational analysis challenging.

**Structural Changes**: Reorganizations, mergers, and system implementations can create discontinuities in how data is structured and categorized, complicating historical analysis.

**Data Entry Errors**: Manual data entry inevitably leads to typographical errors, transposed numbers, and other mistakes that affect data quality.

**Logical Inconsistencies**: Data may contain logical contradictions, such as termination dates preceding hire dates, performance reviews for employees who had already left, or impossible age values.

### Impact of Poor Data Quality on HR Decisions

The consequences of poor data quality extend far beyond technical frustrations—they directly impact business decisions and outcomes:

**Flawed Strategic Planning**: Inaccurate workforce demographics or turnover trends can lead to misaligned strategic workforce plans and resource allocation.

**Compensation Inequities**: Duplicate records or inconsistent job classifications can mask pay disparities or create artificial ones, leading to compliance risks and employee dissatisfaction.

**Misguided Interventions**: Incomplete performance data may result in misdirected training investments or development programs that don't address true skill gaps.

**Recruitment Inefficiencies**: Inaccurate source tracking or candidate conversion rates can lead to continued investment in low-yield recruitment channels.

**Diminished Trust in HR Analytics**: When executives spot obvious data errors in reports, their confidence in the entire analytics function diminishes, reducing HR's strategic influence.

**Wasted Resources**: Analysts may spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data rather than generating insights, resulting in significant opportunity costs.

**Legal and Compliance Risks**: Inconsistent or inaccurate data about protected characteristics or employment actions can create legal vulnerabilities in audit or litigation scenarios.

### Establishing Data Governance for HR

To address these challenges systematically, HR departments need to establish proper data governance frameworks:

**Data Ownership and Stewardship**: Clear assignment of responsibility for data quality across HR functions, with designated data stewards for critical data domains such as employee records, compensation, and performance.

**Data Standards and Definitions**: Documented standards for how HR data should be formatted, coded, and maintained, including data dictionaries that define each field and acceptable values.

**Data Quality Metrics**: Regular measurement and reporting on data quality indicators such as completeness, accuracy, consistency, and timeliness.

**Data Collection Protocols**: Standardized processes for gathering, validating, and entering HR data, including validation rules and quality checks at the point of entry.

**Change Management Procedures**: Formal processes for managing changes to data structures, coding schemes, or systems that might impact data consistency.

**Data Integration Framework**: Guidelines for how data should flow between systems, including mapping rules, transformation logic, and reconciliation procedures.

**Data Quality Improvement Cycle**: Regular review of data quality issues with structured processes for remediation and prevention of recurring problems.

**Training and Awareness**: Education for HR staff about data quality principles and their role in maintaining high-quality data.

Implementing even basic data governance practices can dramatically improve HR data quality over time. For many organizations, this represents a cultural shift—from viewing data as a byproduct of HR transactions to recognizing it as a strategic asset requiring intentional management.

## 4.3. Excel-Based Approach to Data Cleaning

Despite the growing availability of sophisticated data tools, Microsoft Excel remains the primary tool for many HR professionals. Excel offers powerful data cleaning capabilities that can address many common HR data issues without requiring specialized technical skills.

### Excel Functions for Data Standardization

**Text Standardization**:
- `PROPER()`, `UPPER()`, and `LOWER()` functions can standardize text case (e.g., converting "information technology", "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY", and "Information technology" to a consistent format)
- `TRIM()` removes extra spaces that often creep into data (e.g., " HR " becomes "HR")
- `SUBSTITUTE()` replaces specific text patterns (e.g., changing "Human Resources" to "HR")
- `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, and `MID()` extract portions of text fields when needed

```
=PROPER(TRIM(A2))  # Converts "  human resources  " to "Human Resources"
=SUBSTITUTE(A2, "Human Resources", "HR")  # Standardizes department names
```

**Date Standardization**:
- `DATE()` constructs proper Excel date values from separate year, month, and day components
- `DATEVALUE()` converts text that looks like dates into actual Excel date values
- Custom formatting (Format Cells > Number > Date) ensures consistent display formats

```
=DATEVALUE("2023/04/15")  # Converts text date to Excel date value
=DATE(RIGHT(A2,4), MID(A2,4,2), LEFT(A2,2))  # Converts "15/04/2023" format to Excel date
```

**Number Standardization**:
- `VALUE()` converts text that represents numbers into actual numeric values
- Custom number formatting ensures consistent display of decimals, percentages, and currencies
- `ROUND()`, `ROUNDUP()`, and `ROUNDDOWN()` handle decimal precision consistently

```
=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(A2, "$", ""))  # Converts "$45,000" to numeric 45000
=ROUND(A2, 2)  # Rounds to 2 decimal places
```

**Code and Category Standardization**:
- `VLOOKUP()` or `XLOOKUP()` can map non-standard values to standard ones using a reference table
- `IF()` or nested `IF()` statements can handle conditional standardization logic
- `CHOOSE()` can map numeric codes to standardized text values

```
=VLOOKUP(A2, LookupTable, 2, FALSE)  # Maps variations to standard values
=IF(A2="IT", "Information Technology", IF(A2="Tech", "Information Technology", A2))
```

### Identifying and Handling Missing Values

Excel provides several approaches to address missing values in HR data:

**Identifying Missing Values**:
- `ISBLANK()` identifies truly empty cells
- `COUNTBLANK()` counts empty cells in a range
- Conditional formatting can visually highlight missing values
- Filters can show only rows with blanks in specific columns

```
=ISBLANK(A2)  # Returns TRUE if cell is empty
=COUNTBLANK(A2:A100)/COUNTA(A2:A100)  # Calculates % of missing values
```

**Handling Missing Values**:
- `IFERROR()` combined with other functions can substitute default values for errors
- `IF(ISBLANK())` constructs allow for default values for empty cells
- Average, median, or mode functions can impute missing numeric values
- Lookup tables can fill in missing categorical values based on related fields

```
=IF(ISBLANK(A2), "Not Specified", A2)  # Replaces blanks with "Not Specified"
=IF(ISBLANK(A2), AVERAGEIF(A:A, "<>"), A2)  # Replaces blanks with column average
```

### Removing Duplicates and Inconsistencies

Excel offers both manual and automated approaches to handling duplicate records:

**Identifying Duplicates**:
- Conditional formatting with the "Duplicate Values" rule highlights potential duplicates
- `COUNTIF()` or `COUNTIFS()` can count occurrences of values or combinations of values
- Sorting and filtering help visually identify similar records that might be duplicates

```
=COUNTIF(A:A, A2)>1  # Identifies duplicate values in column A
=COUNTIFS(A:A, A2, B:B, B2)>1  # Identifies duplicates based on two columns
```

**Removing Duplicates**:
- The "Remove Duplicates" feature (Data tab) automatically eliminates duplicate rows based on specified columns
- For more control, sorting and manual removal allows selective handling of duplicates
- Creating a unique identifier with `CONCATENATE()` or `&` can help identify duplicates across multiple fields

**Resolving Inconsistencies**:
- The Data Validation feature prevents future inconsistencies by restricting inputs to allowed values
- Find and Replace (Ctrl+H) can correct common inconsistencies en masse
- Pivot Tables can reveal inconsistent categorizations by showing all unique values in a field

```
# Creating a validation list for departments
Data Validation > Allow: List > Source: "HR,Finance,IT,Marketing,Operations"

# Finding all variations of department names
=UNIQUE(A2:A100)  # In Excel 365/2021, shows all unique department values
```

While Excel has limitations for very large datasets or complex transformations, it remains a powerful and accessible tool for HR data cleaning. For many HR professionals, mastering these Excel techniques provides an immediate productivity boost without requiring investment in specialized analytics software or programming skills.

## 4.4. AI Prompt + Python Code for Data Preparation

As HR data increases in volume and complexity, Python becomes an increasingly valuable tool for data preparation. AI systems like Claude can help HR professionals without programming expertise leverage Python by generating code based on natural language prompts.

### Prompts for Data Cleaning Tasks

**Effective AI Prompt Example 1: Consolidating Multiple Data Sources**

```
I need Python code to consolidate HR data from three different sources:
1. An Excel file called "employee_data.xlsx" with employee demographics (sheet name: "Demographics")
2. A CSV file called "performance_ratings.csv" with annual performance reviews
3. A CSV file called "training_completion.csv" with training records

The files are related by employee ID, which is called "Emp_ID" in the first file, "Employee_Number" in the second file, and "EID" in the third file.

I need to:
1. Merge these files into a single DataFrame
2. Handle any missing values appropriately
3. Standardize column names to be consistent
4. Export the cleaned, consolidated data to a new CSV file

Please provide commented code showing each step of this process.
```

**Effective AI Prompt Example 2: Cleaning Text Data**

```
I need Python code to clean the following text-based HR data fields in a CSV file called "employee_records.csv":
1. Department names (column "Dept") - need to standardize case, remove extra spaces, and map variations to standard names (e.g., "IT", "I.T.", "Info Tech" should all become "Information Technology")
2. Job titles (column "Title") - need to standardize case, remove extra spaces
3. Date fields (columns "HireDate" and "ReviewDate") - need to convert to datetime format and handle various input formats

Please provide pandas code with comments to perform these cleaning operations.
```

**Effective AI Prompt Example 3: Identifying and Handling Duplicates**

```
I have an HR dataset in a CSV file called "hr_records.csv" that may contain duplicate employee records. I need Python code to:
1. Identify potential duplicates based on similar names, email addresses, or employee IDs
2. Flag records that are likely duplicates even if not exact matches (e.g., "John Smith" and "Jon Smith" with the same hire date)
3. Create a clean dataset with duplicates removed, keeping the most complete record in each case
4. Generate a report of what records were flagged as duplicates

Please provide pandas code with detailed comments explaining the approach.
```

### Python Code for Combining Multiple HR Data Sources

Here's how the AI might respond to the first prompt above:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Step 1: Load data from different sources
# Loading Excel file with employee demographics
demographics = pd.read_excel('employee_data.xlsx', sheet_name='Demographics')
print(f"Demographics data shape: {demographics.shape}")

# Loading CSV with performance ratings
performance = pd.read_csv('performance_ratings.csv')
print(f"Performance data shape: {performance.shape}")

# Loading CSV with training completion records
training = pd.read_csv('training_completion.csv')
print(f"Training data shape: {training.shape}")

# Step 2: Standardize column names
# Rename ID columns to have consistent naming
demographics = demographics.rename(columns={'Emp_ID': 'employee_id'})
performance = performance.rename(columns={'Employee_Number': 'employee_id'})
training = training.rename(columns={'EID': 'employee_id'})

# Function to standardize all column names to lowercase with underscores
def standardize_column_names(df):
    df.columns = [col.lower().replace(' ', '_') for col in df.columns]
    return df

# Apply standardization to all dataframes
demographics = standardize_column_names(demographics)
performance = standardize_column_names(performance)
training = standardize_column_names(training)

# Step 3: Merge the datasets
# First merge demographics with performance
merged_data = pd.merge(demographics, performance, on='employee_id', how='outer')

# Then merge with training data
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, training, on='employee_id', how='outer')

print(f"Merged data shape: {merged_data.shape}")

# Step 4: Handle missing values
# Check missing values in the merged dataset
missing_count = merged_data.isnull().sum()
print(f"Missing values by column:\n{missing_count}")

# Fill missing categorical values with 'Unknown'
categorical_columns = merged_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns
merged_data[categorical_columns] = merged_data[categorical_columns].fillna('Unknown')

# Fill missing numerical values with median of each column
numerical_columns = merged_data.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns
for col in numerical_columns:
    merged_data[col] = merged_data[col].fillna(merged_data[col].median())

# For date columns, leave as NaT (not a time) to indicate missing
date_columns = merged_data.select_dtypes(include=['datetime']).columns
# No imputation for date columns - missing dates remain missing

# Step 5: Export cleaned and consolidated data
# Export to CSV
merged_data.to_csv('consolidated_hr_data.csv', index=False)
print("Data consolidation complete. Output saved to 'consolidated_hr_data.csv'")

# Optional: Data quality report
print("\nData Quality Report:")
print(f"Total employee records: {merged_data.shape[0]}")
print(f"Complete records: {merged_data.dropna().shape[0]}")
print(f"Records with some missing values: {merged_data.shape[0] - merged_data.dropna().shape[0]}")
print(f"Columns with highest missing rate: {missing_count.sort_values(ascending=False).head(3)}")
```

### Automated Data Quality Assessment

Python can also be used to perform automated data quality assessments that would be tedious or impossible in Excel:

```python
# Import necessary libraries

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the HR dataset

The AI-assisted Python approach provides several advantages over Excel for complex HR data preparation tasks:

1. **Scalability**: Can handle much larger datasets than Excel
2. **Reproducibility**: Code documents exactly what was done and can be rerun on updated data
3. **Automation**: Entire cleaning workflows can be automated for regular use
4. **Advanced techniques**: Access to sophisticated data cleaning methods not available in Excel
5. **Quality reporting**: Generates comprehensive data quality reports

By using AI to generate the code, HR professionals can leverage these benefits without needing to become Python experts themselves.

## 4.5. Descriptive Analytics Techniques

Once HR data has been properly prepared and cleaned, descriptive analytics can reveal valuable patterns and insights. Descriptive analytics answers the question "What happened?" and provides the foundation for more advanced diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.

### Summary Statistics for HR Metrics

Summary statistics provide a concise overview of key HR metrics and their distributions. Common summary statistics include:

**Central Tendency Measures**:
- **Mean**: The average value of a metric (e.g., average tenure is 4.2 years)
- **Median**: The middle value when data is ordered (e.g., median salary is $65,000)
- **Mode**: The most common value (e.g., most common department is Operations)

**Dispersion Measures**:
- **Range**: The difference between maximum and minimum values
- **Variance**: The average of squared differences from the mean
- **Standard Deviation**: The square root of variance, indicating how spread out values are
- **Percentiles**: Values below which a certain percentage of observations fall

**Distribution Characteristics**:
- **Skewness**: Indicates if the distribution is asymmetrical (positively or negatively skewed)
- **Kurtosis**: Measures whether the distribution has heavier or lighter tails than a normal distribution

In an HR context, summary statistics might reveal:
- Typical compensation levels and ranges across the organization
- Average tenure and its variation across departments
- Performance rating distributions and potential rating biases
- Training completion rates and variations by role or location
- Average time-to-fill for open positions and its variance by job level

### Time-series Analysis of HR Data

Time-series analysis examines how HR metrics change over time, revealing trends, seasonality, and patterns that might otherwise be missed. Key time-series techniques include:

**Trend Analysis**:
- **Growth rates**: Year-over-year or month-over-month changes in headcount, turnover, etc.
- **Moving averages**: Smoothing fluctuations to highlight underlying trends
- **Trend lines**: Fitting lines or curves to identify directional movement

**Seasonality Analysis**:
- Identifying recurring patterns in metrics like hiring, absenteeism, or resignations
- Seasonal decomposition to separate trends from cyclical patterns
- Seasonal adjustment to compare "apples to apples" across time periods

**Event Impact Analysis**:
- Measuring changes in metrics before and after significant events (reorganizations, policy changes, market shifts)
- Identifying lagging and leading indicators of organizational changes

In HR, time-series analysis might reveal:
- Gradual shifts in demographic composition of the workforce
- Seasonal patterns in employee exits (e.g., post-bonus period spikes)
- The impact of new policies on metrics like engagement or productivity
- Changes in recruitment efficiency over time
- Compensation growth trends compared to market benchmarks

### Segmentation Analysis for Workforce Insights

Segmentation divides the workforce into meaningful groups to uncover differences and patterns that might be obscured in aggregate data. Effective segmentation approaches include:

**Demographic Segmentation**:
- Analysis by age groups, gender, ethnicity, educational background
- Comparing metrics across generations (Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z)
- Diversity metrics and representation across organizational levels

**Organizational Segmentation**:
- Comparisons by department, function, or business unit
- Analysis by job level, grade, or role family
- Breakdowns by location, region, or country
- Remote vs. in-office employee comparisons

**Performance Segmentation**:
- High/medium/low performer differences
- Top talent vs. baseline employee metrics
- Performance trajectory groups (improving, stable, declining)

**Tenure-Based Segmentation**:
- New hire vs. established employee comparisons
- Career stage analysis (early, mid, late career)
- Pre/post promotion comparison

Segmentation analysis in HR might reveal:
- Turnover patterns that affect specific employee segments disproportionately
- Performance rating distributions that vary significantly across managers or departments
- Compensation equity issues within specific job families
- Engagement drivers that differ by generation or location
- Career progression rates that vary by initial entry point

Effective descriptive analytics combines these approaches to paint a comprehensive picture of workforce dynamics, providing a foundation for deeper investigation and more advanced analytics.

## 4.6. Results Interpretation

Once descriptive analytics have been performed on cleaned HR data, the critical task becomes interpreting the results in a way that creates meaningful insights for the organization.

### Reading Data Quality Reports

Data quality reports provide visibility into the reliability and completeness of HR data. When reviewing these reports:

**Focus on Impact, Not Just Numbers**:
- Consider how missing values might bias analysis results
- Evaluate whether data issues affect critical decision-making areas
- Prioritize remediation efforts based on business impact, not just technical metrics

**Interpret Trends in Data Quality**:
- Monitor how quality metrics change over time to identify improvements or deteriorations
- Connect quality improvements to specific initiatives or process changes
- Use quality metrics to build business cases for data governance investments

**Communicate Appropriately by Audience**:
- For technical teams: Provide detailed quality metrics and specific issues
- For HR business partners: Translate quality issues into business risks and opportunities
- For executives: Focus on high-level quality indicators and their business implications

Data quality reports should drive action, not just provide information. Effective interpretation leads to targeted improvement efforts that enhance the reliability of all subsequent analytics.

### Understanding Descriptive Statistics in HR Context

Descriptive statistics provide a quantitative snapshot of HR metrics, but their meaning depends on organizational context:

**Measures of Central Tendency**:
- A mean salary that exceeds the median suggests a positively skewed distribution, often indicating a small number of highly-paid outliers
- Mode values in categorical data (like departments or job levels) reveal where resources may be concentrated
- Differences between mean and median can highlight potential inequities in distributions

**Dispersion Measures**:
- High standard deviation in performance ratings may indicate inconsistent rating practices across managers
- Compensation ranges (min to max) that exceed market standards might suggest unstructured salary administration
- Wide interquartile ranges (25th to 75th percentiles) in engagement scores across departments may indicate inconsistent employee experiences

**Comparative Statistics**:
- Internal ratios (e.g., highest to lowest salary, executive to average employee compensation) reveal internal equity patterns
- External comparisons (e.g., company turnover vs. industry average) provide competitive context
- Time-based comparisons (current vs. historical metrics) reveal trends and progress

When interpreting descriptive statistics in HR, consider:

1. **Reference Points**: Compare to historical values, targets, benchmarks, or peer organizations
2. **Context Factors**: Account for organizational changes, market conditions, or policy shifts
3. **Segmentation Insights**: Look for meaningful differences across employee groups
4. **Statistical vs. Practical Significance**: Large datasets may show statistically significant differences that lack practical importance

### Translating Findings into Actionable Insights

The ultimate goal of HR analytics is not data or even insights—it's better decisions and actions. Translating findings into actionable insights requires:

**Connecting to Business Questions**:
- Link statistical findings directly to the original business questions
- Translate technical observations into business language
- Prioritize findings based on strategic relevance, not just statistical significance

**Providing Context and Implications**:
- Explain what the numbers mean in practical terms
- Outline potential causes and consequences of observed patterns
- Describe how findings might affect business outcomes

**From Description to Recommendation**:
- Move beyond reporting what happened to suggesting what should be done
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations based on the data
- Include multiple options when appropriate, with pros and cons

**Visualization for Impact**:
- Use appropriate charts and graphs to make patterns immediately visible
- Design visualizations that tell a clear story
- Highlight key findings visually to focus attention on what matters most

Examples of translating HR findings into insights:

* **Raw Finding**: "Turnover rate is 15% overall but 24% in the Technology department."
* **Actionable Insight**: "Technology department turnover is 60% higher than company average and costs approximately $2.1M annually in replacement costs. Exit interview analysis suggests that limited career growth opportunities and below-market compensation for senior developers are the primary drivers. Recommended actions include developing a technical career ladder and conducting a targeted compensation review for senior technical roles."

* **Raw Finding**: "Mean time-to-hire is 45 days with a standard deviation of 22 days."
* **Actionable Insight**: "Our hiring process shows high variability, with some positions filled in under 3 weeks while others take over 2 months. Positions with standardized interview processes show 40% faster completion times. Implementing structured interview processes across all departments could reduce average time-to-hire by an estimated 15 days, allowing us to secure top candidates before competitors."

Effective insight translation requires both analytical skills and business understanding—the ability to see patterns in numbers and translate them into meaningful business implications and actions.

The choice between Excel and Python isn't binary. Many organizations successfully implement hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of each tool while minimizing their limitations.

## 4.9. Troubleshooting Guidance

Even with careful planning, data preparation projects often encounter issues. These troubleshooting approaches help resolve common challenges in HR data cleaning and analysis.

### Diagnosing Data Import Issues

When data doesn't import correctly into analysis tools:

**File Format Problems**:
- Check if the file extension matches the actual format (e.g., CSV files saved as .xlsx)
- Verify character encoding (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.) matches the tool's expectations
- Look for BOM (Byte Order Mark) characters that can disrupt imports
- Test with a small sample file to isolate format issues

**Delimiter Confusion**:
- Check if the delimiter (comma, tab, semicolon) is consistent throughout the file
- Look for the delimiter character appearing within text fields (often causing column misalignment)
- Verify quote characters are properly used around text containing delimiters
- Try different delimiter settings during import

**Size Limitations**:
- Check if file exceeds tool limits (Excel's row/column limits, memory constraints)
- Try splitting large files into smaller chunks for import
- Consider sampling rather than importing entire large datasets
- Use streaming imports in Python for very large files

**Network and Permission Issues**:
- Verify file access permissions for the importing user
- Check network stability for large file transfers
- Try local copies if network drives are causing issues
- Check for file locks from other users or processes

### Resolving Inconsistent Data Formats

When data formats vary within supposedly consistent fields:

**Date Format Inconsistencies**:
- Identify all date formats present in the data (US, European, ISO, etc.)
- Use conditional formatting to highlight inconsistent formats
- In Excel, use custom formulas to standardize various formats
- In Python, use flexible date parsing with explicit format specification

**Text Case and Structure Issues**:
- Create frequency tables of text values to identify variations
- Use text standardization functions (PROPER, UPPER, TRIM, etc.)
- Build mapping tables for common variants
- Consider fuzzy matching for highly variable text

**Number Format Problems**:
- Check for numbers stored as text (often right-aligned in Excel)
- Look for currency symbols, commas, or special characters mixed with numbers
- Verify decimal separators are consistent (periods vs. commas)
- Test for implicit number formats (percentages stored as decimals or vice versa)

**Mixed Data Types in Columns**:
- Identify columns with mixed data types (e.g., numbers and text mixed)
- Determine if mixed types indicate data errors or legitimate variation
- Consider splitting mixed-type columns into multiple columns
- Use conditional logic to handle different types appropriately

### Handling Outliers in HR Data

Outliers can significantly impact HR analysis results and require careful handling:

**Identifying True Outliers**:
- Calculate z-scores (standard deviations from mean) to identify statistical outliers
- Use box plots to visualize potential outliers (typically 1.5 × IQR beyond quartiles)
- Create scatter plots to see outliers in relationship to other variables
- Check for impossible or highly improbable values (e.g., negative tenure, 200% compensation ratios)

**Validating Potential Outliers**:
- Verify outliers against source systems or documents
- Check for data entry or calculation errors
- Consult with business experts to determine if extreme values are possible
- Look for patterns among outliers (same time period, location, etc.)

**Handling Approaches**:
- Correction: Fix values that are clearly errors
- Retention: Keep legitimate outliers but note their presence
- Capping: Set ceiling/floor values for analysis purposes
- Transformation: Apply mathematical transformations (log, square root) to reduce outlier impact
- Segregation: Analyze outliers separately from the main dataset
- Robust methods: Use statistical techniques less sensitive to outliers

**Documenting Outlier Decisions**:
- Record identified outliers and their handling
- Document the rationale for outlier treatment decisions
- Note the impact of outliers on analysis results
- Consider sensitivity analysis with and without outliers

Effective troubleshooting requires a combination of technical skills, domain knowledge, and detective work. By approaching data issues systematically and documenting both problems and solutions, HR analytics teams build institutional knowledge that makes future data preparation more efficient.
