Introduction to Machine Learning

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning concepts and techniques.

Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns, make decisions, and improve their performance through experience.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Uses labeled data to train models
2. Unsupervised Learning - Discovers patterns in unlabeled data  
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learns through interaction and feedback

Chapter 2: Common Algorithms
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Decision Trees: Makes decisions based on feature splits
- Neural Networks: Mimics human brain structure
- Support Vector Machines: Finds optimal decision boundaries

Chapter 3: Applications
Machine learning is used in various fields including:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection and risk assessment
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
- Entertainment: Recommendation systems

This foundational knowledge will help you understand how machine learning systems work and their real-world applications.
